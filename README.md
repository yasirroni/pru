# Python Requirements Updater

Not [`pur`](https://github.com/alanhamlett/pip-update-requirements), but [`pru`](https://github.com/yasirroni/pru). It updates and resolves `requirements.txt` based on the current Python environment and `pip` version. Unlike [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) and other dependency management tools, `pru` can be used outside your project and doesn't need to be included as a project dependency. Just run `pru` whenever you want to install the latest packages and update `requirements.txt` accordingly.

For example, turn this `requirements.txt`:

```txt
requests>=2.32.1
numpy<=1.26.3
pandas==2.2.1
scipy
```

into this:

```txt
requests==2.32.3
numpy==2.0.0
pandas==2.2.2
scipy==1.14.0
```

The primary purpose of `pru` is to update packages and pin their versions in `requirements.txt`. The motivation behind this is that, unlike `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` should lock the versions of the packages currently used in the environment to ensure future reproducibility. This is best suited for repositories containing experiments and examples, not for package development.

## Installation

```shell
pip install pru
```

## Usage

`pru` has multiple use cases. The main utilities (but not limited to) are:

1. `upgrade_requirements`: upgrade and pin requirements.
2. `replace_requirements_packages_versions`: update and pin the requirements file based on the installed packages.
3. `get_installed_packages_name_and_version`: list the installed packages and their versions.
4. `get_installed_requirements_packages_and_version`: list the installed packages and their versions, based on the list of packages in the requirements file.

`pru` can be used both as a Python package and from the CLI.

Using CLI:

```shell
pru
```

Explicit run using CLI:

```shell
pru -r "requirements.txt" upgrade_requirements --cmd "pip install --upgrade" -o "requirements.txt"
```

Using Python:

```python
from pru import upgrade_requirements

file_path = 'requirements.txt'
upgrade_requirements(file_path, command='pip install --upgrade')
```

Very useful in workflows:

```yaml
      - name: Upgrade pip and install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pru
```

or to debug installed packages in a workflow:

```yaml
      - name: Run pru if tests fail
        if: steps.pytest.outcome != 'success'
        run: |
          python_version_minor=$(python -c "import sys; print(f'{sys.version_info.minor}')")
          pru -r pytests/requirements/3_${python_version_minor}/requirements.txt
          echo "Contents of pytests/requirements/3_${python_version_minor}/requirements.txt:"
          cat pytests/requirements/3_${python_version_minor}/requirements.txt
```

## Known Issue

In Python 3.7, `pru` *sometimes* cannot install and update requirements using a single call to `upgrade_requirements`. To fix this, simply run the command twice.
